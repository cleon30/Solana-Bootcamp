## **1. Presentation**

In this workshop you will be hands-on building and deploying Solana Programs! 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VigV00PPIHhIcho0MaThDdaWgQjlZyq2mqL2JqV_JxI/edit?usp=sharing

## **2. Introduction**

This workshop will be conducted by cleon in the ewhachain Bootcamp at the Dreamplus Gangnam building. Will be an introductory workshop to start playing with CLI commands, and also to start creating Solana Programs, understanding the logic behind them.   

## **3. Requirements/Installation**

The requirements to get started will depend on your OS.

### **Prerequirements if you are using Windows**

First, you will need to install wsl(Windows Subsystem for Linux) on your computer because Anchor is not windows friendly. 
When you have completed that, you will have to integrate the wsl on Visual Studio Code to be able to work with the terminal. 
Now you are ready to install everything :)
### **Installation**

You will have to install Rust Programming language, Solana, Yarn and Anchor. There is a brief tutorial in: https://book.anchor-lang.com/getting_started/installation.html


## **4. Command Line Interface(CLI)**

### **4.1 Getting Started with your Anchor project!**

The CLI is a very important tool for Blockchain Devs and will be useful to check multiple data on-chain and manage different instructions. To get started correctly, let's begin in the Visual Studio Code environment!

We will have to open an empty folder that will be used for our Solana Project. After that, we will open a new Terminal.

Nice, now let's Initialize our Anchor Environment! For our CLI commands will not be necessary at all, but will be useful in order to know where is your Solana Wallet inside your computer.
```anchor init counter
```

Good! Now we are ready to play with CLI commands :) 

### **4.2 Working on localhost**

In this workshop we will be working on Localhost, this means that we will be running a Solana Blockchain inside our computer. For that we will also need to create a validator. 

### **4.3 Fungible Tokens**r

### **4.4 Non Fungible Tokens(NFT)**

## **5. Deploy your first Solana Program**

### **5.1 Structure of an Anchor Project**

### **5.2 Hello Solana World! ‚òÄÔ∏è**

### **5.3 Basic Counter üìù**

### **5.4 Advanced Counter**

### **5.5 Extra: Lottery üé∞**
