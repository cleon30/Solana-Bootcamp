## **1. Presentation**

In this workshop you will be hands-on building and deploying Solana Programs! 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VigV00PPIHhIcho0MaThDdaWgQjlZyq2mqL2JqV_JxI/edit?usp=sharing

## **2. Introduction**

This workshop will be conducted by cleon in the ewhachain Bootcamp at the Dreamplus Gangnam building. Will be an introductory workshop to start playing with CLI commands, and also to start creating Solana Programs, understanding the logic behind them.   

## **3. Requirements/Installation**

The requirements to get started will depend on your OS.

### **Prerequirements if you are using Windows**

First, you will need to install wsl(Windows Subsystem for Linux) on your computer because Anchor is not windows friendly. 
When you have completed that, you will have to integrate the wsl on Visual Studio Code to be able to work with the terminal. 
Now you are ready to install everything :)
### **Installation**

You will have to install Rust Programming language, Solana, Yarn and Anchor. There is a brief tutorial in: https://book.anchor-lang.com/getting_started/installation.html


## **4. Command Line Interface(CLI)**

### **4.1 Getting Started with your Anchor project!**

The CLI is a very important tool for Blockchain Devs and will be useful to check multiple data on-chain and manage different instructions. To get started correctly, let's begin in the Visual Studio Code environment!

We will have to open an empty folder that will be used for our Solana Project. After that, we will open a new Terminal.

<img width="600" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62452212/193342404-d9945fb0-d496-4d88-a2af-932748719fcd.png">

Nice, now let's Initialize our Anchor Environment! For our CLI commands will not be necessary at all, but will be useful in order to know where is your Solana Wallet inside your computer. And in the Anchor.toml file we will see where is our wallet located.

```bash
anchor init hello-world
```

<img width="1427" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62452212/193345945-0c7d7329-21aa-4374-9845-eedccf80d04a.png">

Good! Now we are ready to play with CLI commands :) 

### **4.2 Working on localhost**

In this workshop we will be working on Localhost, this means that we will be running a Solana Blockchain inside our computer. For that we will also need to create a validator.
First, let's set our network to Localhost.

```bash
solana config set --url localhost
```

After that, let's create a Validator on our Localhost to initialize our own Solana Blockchain

```bash
solana-test-validator
```

It should appear something like this:

<img width="512" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62452212/193347096-767232be-98af-4e4c-8a55-19a9cc34c121.png">

Good! The Validator will be running in that terminal, so let's open another terminal.

Now, let's try to send some SOL to our wallet address with the airdrop command.

```bash
solana airdrop 200 ~/.config/solana/id.json
```
```bash
solana account ~/.config/solana/id.json
```

And also, will be important to set our keypair to create the Tokens from next steps!

```bash
solana config set --keypair ~/.config/solana/id.json
```
<img width="552" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62452212/193349615-dcc083e0-9669-405c-a6a3-765f9f1c1176.png">


### **4.3 Fungible Tokens**

We will be using SPL token libraries to create Fungible and Non Fungible Tokens.
Let's create a token:
```bash
spl-token create-token
```
You should see something like:

<img width="673" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62452212/193350609-3257f678-612f-4ffe-9b1b-12bf85a669c1.png">

Note that this doesn't have a supply yet
You can test this with

```bash
spl-token supply <Token ID>
```
Now create an account to hold the token

```bash
spl-token create-account <Token ID>
```
<img width="650" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62452212/193351691-579c18dc-9781-44cd-baee-466ee7e0866a.png">

Mint some tokens into that account

```bash
spl-token mint <Token ID> 21000000
```

<img width="650" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62452212/193351994-8650ed0f-6e2d-48af-9b76-f017c9f20618.png">

You can check the token balance for an account with
```bash
spl-token balance <Token ID>
```
and the supply with
```bash
spl-token supply <Token ID>
```
If you want a summary of the tokens that you own use:
```bash
spl-token accounts
```

#### **Transfering Tokens**

```bash
spl-token transfer <Token ID> <amount> <destination>
```
Note that the destination account must already be set up for that token
If the account is not already setup for that token you can use:
```bash
spl-token transfer --fund-recipient <Token ID> <amount> <destination> --allow-unfunded-recipient
```
<img width="639" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62452212/193354179-3f93b85c-3ade-449e-b3f2-03d524119100.png">


### **4.4 Non Fungible Tokens(NFT)**

To create an NFT we must create a Token with 0 decimals.
```bash
spl-token create-token --decimals 0
```
Setup an associated account as a fungible token 
```bash
spl-token create-account <Token ID>
```
Then, we must mint 1 Token to that account
```bash
spl-token mint <Token ID> 1 <Account>
```

And finally, we must disable future minting 
```bash
spl-token authorize <Token ID> mint --disable
```
You can check the token details with
```bash
spl-token account-info <Token ID>
```
<img width="1022" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62452212/193357022-6cea7e79-1e6e-4f82-a4a3-84b39f0c937e.png">

## **5. Deploy your first Solana Program**


### **5.1 Structure of an Anchor Project**

We already have created our Anchor environment, so the next step will be to understand the most important parts!

So, our environment look something like this:

<img width="180" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62452212/193358066-e0bfa16b-d51a-421f-a003-b277b476897c.png">

In the picture, you can see three different colors representing the most relevant parts of the project: red-Smart Contract, blue-tests, green-project configuration.

For building and compiling our smart contract we will use 
```bash 
anchor build
```
And for deploying to the Solana Blockchain we will use
```bash 
anchor deploy
```
(make sure you have enough SOL in the wallet, if not it will fail) 

Finally, for testing we will use

```bash
anchor run test 
```
Also need to mention that if we are working on Localhost, we must have a validator running.

### **5.2 Hello Solana World! ‚òÄÔ∏è**

Noice.
Now we are ready for our First solana program :D
Basically the First Program will consist of a simple message inside the Blockchain.
<img width="489" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62452212/193385007-579b8a26-4c2b-4a2e-96f9-9aa54a085299.png">

Now let's build and compile it
```bash
anchor build
```
Everything good? Now let's get some SOL Airdrop to our Project Wallet before deploying our program to the Blockchain.
```bash
solana airdrop 200 ~/.config/solana/id.json
```
```bash
anchor deploy
```
After you deploy your program, you will receive a new Program ID. This ID will be the account that is storing the program in our blockchain! So basically it will recognise our Program using this ID.

<img width="553" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62452212/193385706-65404826-9dbc-4e7c-bfd9-c88a66d62b54.png">

Now let's copy this Program ID and add it to our files. We will have to change the Program ID inside the lib.rs file, and the Program ID inside Anchor.toml

<img width="417" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62452212/193385830-885509d8-d4d8-4d53-9f7b-8394a5d0a0d9.png">
<img width="410" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62452212/193385848-ad34268e-999f-4bf0-9d6d-ed2a43db01c9.png">

*Important* - We will have to compile and deploy again to make it work

```bash
anchor build && anchor deploy
```
Before testing it, let's open an additional terminal and write
```bash
solana logs
```
Using this command we will see all the interactions that are happening on our Localhost blockchain. So, we will see what is happening in the transactions on-chain.

Let's test our program then
```bash
anchor run test
```
